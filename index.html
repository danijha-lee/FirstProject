    <p>
        The lorem ipsum is based on De finibus bonorum et malorum, a Latin text written by Cicero in 45 BC. Typographers
        and
        printers have used passages from this work for formatting since the 16th century. Many words have been added or
        modified over all the centuries. As a result, the lorem ipsum is no longer considered Latin, even though it
        indeed
        looks a lot
        like it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The lorem ipsum gets its name from the Latin phrase Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit
        amet.
        which translates to “Nor is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is
        pain.”
