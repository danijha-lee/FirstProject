        <h3>Everything I know about Marvel</h3>
        <h5 class="text-center">About Black Panther</h5>
        <p>T'Challa aka the Black Panther is the head of state for the African nation of Wakanda, the most
            technologically advanced country on Earth. In this role, he was the King/Chieftain, religious leader, and
            commander-in-chief all rolled into one. He was also considered among the top intellects in the
            world. Using Wakanda's advanced Vibranium technology and his own abilities and fortune, he pledged his
            life to the service of all humankind.

       <h5 class="text-center">About Gamora</h5>
       <p> Gamora is a former Zehoberei assassin and a former member of the Guardians of the Galaxy. She became the
           adopted daughter of Thanos and adopted sister of Nebula after he killed half of her race. Gamora served him
           for years before betraying him in an attempt to free herself from his ways. She was hired to steal the Orb,
           and after becoming involved in the Quest for the Orb, she befriended the other members of the Guardians of
           the Galaxy. After the Battle of Xandar, she left to work with them all. Having made a deal with the Sovereign
           to kill the Abilisk, Gamora was able to regain custody of Nebula with the intention of finally bringing her
           to justice in Xandar.
